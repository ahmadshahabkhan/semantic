                    <p>Numerous studies have investigated the ways in which stray and companion cats can negatively impact wildlife through
                    threats such as predation and disease transmission. But, very few studies have investigated how domestic dogs may pose
                    similar threats. This paper, published in Biological Conservation, builds on the few studies that have examined the
                    impact of dogs on wildlife. It assesses the global prevalence of different types of dog impact. And it identifies
                    hotspots containing high numbers of impacted species.</p>

                <aside>
<p>The total number of affected species includes 96 mammalian, 78 avian, 22 reptilian, and three amphibian species. The
authors note that previous studies identified large numbers of mammals but not large numbers of birds.</p>
